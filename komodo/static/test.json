I can split the CLC column into 2, since CLCs now range from ~$50 to $150. If I split them, it will be by size, not price.<br><br>3- Akasa Venom, Prolimatech Megahalems. Both of these were once recommended. Are they still worth buying?<br><br>4- For the ultra budget, Arctic Cooling is a good choice, as they have lots of stuff from ~$15-$35.

I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but you can only use electronics which are compatible with 240 volts or else you might damage your electronics. I know this is true for space heaters\/dryers, etc. but can I really damage my monitor by plugging it into a 240 volt outlet? I thought it was standard for all computer electronics to be 120v\/240v compatible? Anybody have any experience with this type of thing?",

The computers would not only need drivers, but installation of some programs that won&#039;t come with a default install which may already be installed on the computers.

(If you&#039;re not sure, the Windows Experience Index can tell you that. Just click the detailed report.)<br><br>On a side note, this guide can help improve performance.

What you\u2019re referring to as Bug Traps, is in fact, RAID\/Bug Traps, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, RAID plus Bug Traps. Bug Traps is not a bug trapping device unto itself, but rather a free component of a fully functioning RAID system made useful by the RAID proprietary chemicals, spray cans and vital chemical components comprising a full bugspray as defined by by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son.<br>Many users run a modified or free version of RAID every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of RAID which is widely used today is often called \u201cBug Traps\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the RAID system, developed by the RAID Project. There really is a Bug Traps, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Bug Traps is like the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an bug spray, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete bug spray. Bug Traps is normally used in combination with the RAID bug spray: the whole system is basically RAID with Bug Traps added, or RAID\/Bug Traps. All the so-called \u201cBug Traps\u201d distributions are really distributions of RAID\/Bug Traps.",

I&#039;ve been googling and reading wiki pages and shit and I honestly have no idea what the fuck to do. Most help pages I find are to do with dealing with Secure Boot which isn&#039;t a problem as this isn&#039;t a laptop.<br><br>So far what I&#039;ve gathered is to create a ~1gigabyte FAT32 partition with gdisk and give it a boot flag.

Humor my vision, \/g\/.<br><br>My observations:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phones and tables are still pretty much used as low-end devices for simple purposes, like reading, browsing or playing retarded games. Because of UI constraints, there&#039;s no sign of this changing.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PCs have reached a state of maturity, where it&#039;s no longer meaningful for most people to chase the latest hardware. PCs aren&#039;t actually &quot;dying&quot;, it&#039;s just that people take them for granted, so they aren&#039;t the latest hip gadget to chase after, and pretty much everyone actually has one. They&#039;re used for a larger diversity of tasks than phones or tablets because of their UI, however.<\/span><br><br>So how about a new kind of phone? One with the same kind of relatively simple hardware found in current smartphones and the same touchscreen hardware, but also with a mini-DisplayPort, which can connect to a small monitor\/USB multiplexer device. (DisplayPort can carry USB channels as well.)<br><br>The phone would be installed with a normal desktop operating system, like Windows or Linux, which would constitute the &quot;primary UI&quot;, and would be used via the monitor\/USB multiplexer device, kinda like a docking station. But when unplugged, it runs a simpler UI on its built-in screen. Applications that are normally desktop programs can also implement a simplified mobile UI via which they can be used in portable mode to provide limited functionality while on the move.<br><br>There could also be hybrid devices with larger screens which could connect an optional keyboard\/mouse via Bluetooth or something.<br><br>Unless you have needs that require much better hardware, like gayman or visualization or something srs, this would obviate the need to have a separate PC and mobile device.<br><br>Amirite?",
